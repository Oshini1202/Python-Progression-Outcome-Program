# Python-Progression-Outcome-Program
This is a program to predict progression outcomes at the end of each academic year.  

Part 1 -  Student Version 

The program includes below functionalities.

1. allow students to predict their progression outcome at the end of each academic year. 
2. prompt for the number of credits at pass, defer and fail and then display the appropriate progression outcome for an individual student. 
3. let the user know if a credit input is the wrong data type. I.e., ‘Integers required’ is displayed. 
4. let the user know if credits are not in the range 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120. I.e., ‘Range error’ is displayed. 
5. let the user know if the total of the pass, defer and fail credits is not 120. I.e., ‘Total incorrect’ is displayed. 

Part 2 - Staff Version 

This part allows a staff member to predict progression outcomes for multiple students and it includes below functionalities.

1. prompt for credits at pass, defer and fail and display the appropriate progression for each individual student until the staff member user enters ‘q’ to quit. 
2. When ‘q’ is entered, the program should produce a ‘histogram’ where each star represents a student who achieved a progress outcome in the category range: progress, trailing, module retriever and exclude. See example below. 
3. display the number of students for each progression category and the total number of outcomes processed. 

Part 3 -  A Vertical Histogram

For this staff version the data will be accessed from a list and NOT from user input.
